# Holarchy
During the 2020 New-Media Residency at Mana Contemporary Chicago, Amay Kataria developed a new body of work called [Holons & Holarchy](https://amaykataria.com/#/Holon). Conceptually rooted in Arthur Koestler's book [Ghost in the Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ghost_in_the_Machine), this work present a hierarchy of Holons (Holarchy) that exaggerates the abstract space between finite and infinite. Composed using a precise computer algorithm, these abstract Holarchies repurpose the medium of technology to evoke a philosophical introspection about the interconnectivity, complexity, and stability of organic and inorganic systems that we inhabit in reality. The custom software is capable of generating infinite combinations of these prints.
